 Data Structures & Algorithms

## Reflection
1. Where are you in your coding journey? 
Currently, I am in my last semester of my Computer Programming & Development Associate's degree here at FTCC. I am brushing up on my C++ as it has been quite some time since I've last coded using this language. I am most familiar with Python, but I like both languages.

2. What do you hope to achieve?
I hope to graduate with this degree with a 4.0 GPA, and feel ready to move on into the workforce or in the near future, continue with my education. In the immediate term, I hope to become an even better coder in C++ and fully understand data structures.
